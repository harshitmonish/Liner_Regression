In this problem, we will implement least squares linear regression to predict density of wine based on its acidity. 
    1. The error metric used is least squares.
    2. The files \linearX.csv"and \linearY.csv"contain the acidity of the wine (x(i)'s) and its density (y(i)'s) respectively, with one     
       training example per row. 
    3. Will be implementing least squares linear regression to learn the relation-ship between x(i)'s and y(i)'s.
    4. Will implement batch gradient descent method for optimizing the error metric and will choose an appropriate learning rate.
    5. Will plot the data on a two-dimensional graph and plot the hypothesis function learned by the algorithm.
    6. Will draw a 3-dimensional mesh showing the error function on z-axis and the parameters in the x y plane. Displaying the error value        using the current set of parameters at each iteration of the gradient descent.
