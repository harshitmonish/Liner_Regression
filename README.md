# Project Title: 
## Predict density of wine based on its acidity using Linear regression
In this problem, we will implement least squares linear regression to predict density of wine based on its acidity.

* The error metric used is least squares.
* The files "linearX.csv"and "linearY.csv"contain the acidity of the wine (x(i)'s) and its density (y(i)'s) respectively, with one training example per row.
* Will be implementing least squares linear regression to learn the relation-ship between x(i)'s and y(i)'s.
* Will implement batch gradient descent method for optimizing the error metric and will choose an appropriate learning rate.
* Will plot the data on a two-dimensional graph and plot the hypothesis function learned by the algorithm.
* Will draw a 3-dimensional mesh showing the error function on z-axis and the parameters in the x y plane.Displaying the error value 
    using the current set of parameters at each iteration of the gradient descent.
